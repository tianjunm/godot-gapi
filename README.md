# godot-gapi

[Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive) does not have a client-side library for [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/index.html). This is a working demo that uses Godot's [HTTPRequest](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_httprequest.html#class-httprequest) node to communicate with the Google Drive API in game.
